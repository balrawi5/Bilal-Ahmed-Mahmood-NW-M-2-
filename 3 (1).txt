1. What are the differences between global keyword and $GLOBALS?
Answer/
The global keyword is used to access and modify a specific global variable within the local scope of a function in PHP,
 while $GLOBALS is a superglobal variable that provides access to all global variables from any scope in PHP scripts.

2. Can you write a global keyword in a program with capital letters instead small? 
If your answer is: yes or no, why?
Answer/
No, you cannot write the global keyword with capital letters because PHP is case-sensitive.
The global keyword must be written in lowercase letters exactly as "global".
If you attempt to use "GLOBAL" or any other variation with different case, 
PHP will not recognize it as the global keyword, and you'll encounter a syntax error.

3. Write a PHP script to enter 5 countries with their capital cities in an array and 
print out in descending order.
Answer/
<?php

$capitals = array(
    "France" => "Paris",
    "Germany" => "Berlin",
    "Italy" => "Rome",
    "Spain" => "Madrid",
    "United Kingdom" => "London"
);
arsort($capitals);
echo "Countries and Capitals in Descending Order:\n";
foreach ($capitals as $capital => $country) {
    echo "$capital - $country\n";
}
?>
